 romania.7.t:0 "Supression of the Legion"
 romania.7.d:0 "The founder and charismatic leader of the Iron Guard grew into an important figure within the Romanian political stage during the early 30's, coming into conflict with the political establishment and democratic forces, and often the guard resorted to terrorism. The Legionnaires traditionally referred to Codreanu as the Captain, and he held absolute authority over the organization until his death in the Jilava prison in 1938. \n\nHe registered his main electoral success during the 1937 suffrage, but was stopped by King Carol II and the Romanian Government. The rivalry between Codreanu and moderate politicians like Nicolae Iorga ended with Codreanu's imprisonment at Jilava and assassination at the hands of the military police force. This will upset the Legionarries, but for the safety of all Romanian peoples it was a needed sacrifice."
